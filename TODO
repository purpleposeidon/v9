# Consistency/Ordering Issue
We acquire a bunch of locks.
We do stuff to 'em.
Some events need to be submitted to maintain data consistency
- So NOBODY ELSE can be acquiring locks.
    Suppose we've got this event we need to submit.
    It's gonna modify some other column we don't have a lock on.
    And it's gonna modify a column we DO have a lock on
    Nobody should be allowed to acquire those columns!
        * We need to hold the lock on the edit column until consistency has been propagated.
        * Doing consistency can result in ARBITRARY COLUMN ACCESS!?
        * How 'bout this. ThreadId. Only the current thread can acquire locks.
- They can release locks if they like.
